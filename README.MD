# O2Switch Backup with Restic

* [Documentation in English.](README.MD)
* [Documentation en fran√ßais.](Readme-fr.MD) 

## Script Description<a name="script-description"></a>

This Bash shell script is designed to backup your website's data and MySQL databases from [O2Switch's infrastructure](https://www.o2switch.fr/) to a remote cloud service of your choice.

If you're hosting only WordPress websites on O2Switch, you may only need to edit `backup-restic-conf.txt` and `backup-restic-pwd.txt`, as the default behavior of the script will be sufficient to backup all of your WordPress installations.

The script can automatically detect WordPress installations located in directories at the root of your installation and dump their databases for backup. It uses Restic and Rclone to backup your data in a secure manner on a remote location. Restic is a powerful and easy-to-use backup tool that features strong encryption, efficient deduplication, and compression to help you securely backup and restore your data. Rclone is a versatile and reliable command-line tool that allows you to sync and transfer files between multiple cloud storage providers and other types of storage systems.

The decision to use this script to backup your data with O2Switch's infrastructure is based on their recommendation for users to maintain their own backups in addition to their [Jetbackup](https://faq.o2switch.fr/hebergement-mutualise/tutoriels-cpanel/sauvegarde-jetbackup) solution for restoring backups. This script is designed to follow their recommendation and provide you with a secure and efficient backup solution.

# How-To: Quick Explanation<a name="how-to-quick-explanation"></a>

That short how-to is for those confortable with Restic and O2Swtich capabilities and restrictions.
By default, the script will backup all of your files except the one within hidden folder at the root of your webserver.
All wordpress databases will be backup automatically too.
You will have to follow those steps:
* Install the script. Upload it to the root directory of your webserver and then execute 
```shell
$ ./backup.sh --install
```
* The only mandatory files to edit are the following one in that directory $HOME/scripts/backup
  * backup-restic-conf.txt: Input the path to your restic repository
  * backup-restic-pwd.txt: Input the password of your restic repository
* You can now execute from the directory $HOME/scripts/backup:
```shell
$ ./backup.sh --backup
```

---------------------
* Before you get started with the script, it's a good idea to have some experience with Restic or Rclone. If you're not familiar with these tools, don't worry - I've included some links to documentation that can help you get up to speed. The step-by-step configuration is covering the basic too.
  * [Documentation about Restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_introduction.html)
  * [Documentation to use Rclone with Restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html?highlight=rclone#other-services-via-rclone)

* Restic can backup to multiple cloud services, such as Rest Server, Amazon S3, Minio, and Azure, as well as locally or with SFTP.
  * If you're planning to use SFTP, you'll need to declare your remote server IP in the Cpanel interface to unlock the traffic. We've included a link to the official O2switch documentation that explains how to do this.
    * [Official O2switch documentation](https://faq.o2switch.fr/hebergement-mutualise/tutoriels-cpanel/whitelist-firewall)
    * Cpanel > Outils > Autorisation SSH, and declare you remote server IP on port 22
  * Note that OneDrive services are whitelisted by O2switch and can be used by default with Rclone.

* Finally, it's important to have shell access to your web hosting. If you haven't already requested this, I've included a link to the O2switch documentation that explains how to do it:
  * https://faq.o2switch.fr/hebergement-mutualise/acces-ssh-shell-cli-cmdline

I hope this helps you prepare for using the script. If you have any questions or run into any issues, don't hesitate to reach out - I'm here to help!

Step by step Installation and configuration<a name="step-by-step-installation-and-configuration"></a>
---------------------

### Step 1 - Upload the script and install it.

```shell
  $ # Copy the script backup.sh to your root directory "/home2/username/" either from your cpanel 
  $ # or by using 'nano' to create a new file and copy-paste the content of backup.sh to your file.
  $ #Create a new file with nano and paste the content of backup.sh it, Save that file with Ctrl+O and close it file with Ctrl+X
  $ nano backup.sh
  $ # Make the script executable with the following command.
  $ chmod +x backup.sh
  $ # Execute the script with the argument --install.
  $ backup.sh --install
```
### Step 2 - Edit 'backup-restic-pwd.txt'

Edit the file called `backup-restic-pwd.txt` and save the password inside that you want to use for your restic backup. 
Remember, this password is essential for several Restic tasks, so let's keep a copy of it safe outside of O2switch. Though I don't anticipate any issues, we need to understand how crucial this password is in case of a massive O2switch infrastructure crash. Without it, you won't be able to access any of your Restic backups. So let's take a moment to ensure this password is well-protected and safely backed up!

### Step 3 - Prepare a remote repository to welcome your files.

In any case, first execute the following command in your shell: `export PATH=$PATH:/home2/ufza5835/scripts/backup`
This command is allowing you to use the time of your session the executable "restic" and  "rclone" without typing their full path. (ex: $HOME/scripts/backup/./restic)

#### 3.1 Example with SFTP

Make sure to whitelist the traffic toward your remote server: [Whitelist Firewall](https://faq.o2switch.fr/hebergement-mutualise/tutoriels-cpanel/whitelist-firewall)
You should have a credential to login on your remote server.
Below the command to repare an SSH key on O2switch server and to copy it to your remote server.
This will allow your script to connect without password to your remote server.

```shell
  $ ssh-keygen
  $ # Set all to default with no password
  $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user_remoteserver@host_remoteserver.com
  $ # You will be request for your password for the remote server.
  $ # After that the ssh key will be copy to the remote server and password will not be necessary anymore.
```
It's time to prepare your restic repository

```shell
$ restic -r "sftp:user_remoteserver@host_remoteserver.com:/home/user_remoteserver/restic" init -p $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-restic-pwd.txt
$ # As long as user_remote has enougth permissions, the directory will be automatically created: /home/user_remoteserver/restic
$ # You don't need to type your restic password because its loaded from the file backup-restic-pwd.txt
```
#### 3.2 Example with rclone

If you choose to use the sftp option, you do not need to follow the instructions provided in the rclone example. While creating that guide, I found that Mega has been integrated with rclone in a very useful way. Therefore, you should take the time to create a Mega account, which will give you access to 50GB of free storage. After creating the account, you can run the following command:

```shell
$ rclone config create mymega mega user user@example.com pass Your-Password
  [mymega]
  type = mega
  user = user@example.com
  pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
```
To verify that your rclone configuration is accurate, we will create a file called "demo.txt" and confirm its existence. You can also check this simultaneously using your web browser.

```shell
#Create a file
$ rclone touch mymega:demo.txt
#Check for the file
$ rclone ls mymega:
  0 demo.txt
```

It's time to prepare your restic repository

```shell
$ restic -r "rclone:mymega:restic" init -p $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-restic-pwd.txt
$ # As long as user_remote has enougth permissions, the directory will be automatically created: /restic
$ # You don't need to type your restic password because its loaded from the file backup-restic-pwd.txt
```

### Step 4 - Edit the configuration files

Now let's edit the configuration files.

* `backup-restic-conf.txt`: If you want to keep the default script behavior, only edit 'restic_repo'and 'restic_receive_email'
  * `restic_repo=` Should be similar to the command you wrote previously to init your restic repo. 
    * Example with sftp: sftp:user_remoteserver@host_remoteserver.com:/home/user_remoteserver/restic
    * Excample with rclone: rclone:mymega:restic
  * `restic_receive_email` Define the email address that will receive the logs.
  * `restic_log_file` Edit that value if you want to give a specific name to your log's file.
  * `restic_log_days` Define how many days to keep the log's files.
  * `restic_dump_days` Define how many days to keep the MySQL dumps.
* `backup-db-others.txt`: Edit that file if you want to add specific databases not related to a wordpress installation and that you want to backup.
  * You will need to create an user and to grant him the following permission for those DBs only: `SELECT / LOCK TABLES / SHOW VIEW`
  * Documentation from O2Switch: [Base de donn√©es MySQL](https://faq.o2switch.fr/hebergement-mutualise/tutoriels-cpanel/base-donnees-mysql)
* `backup-excluded-dirs.txt`: Edit that file to add folders to not backup, check the content some folders are excluded by default.
  * You can use the command  `ls -dA .*/ | grep -Ev '^(\./|\.\./)$'` to obtain the list of all hidden folder at the root of your home directory.
    Most of those directories can be excluded from backup. I recommend you to add them within the file.

### Step 5 - Set a cron

You want that script to be automatically executed, for that we use crontab. 
You can do that from [O2switch cpanel](https://faq.o2switch.fr/hebergement-mutualise/tutoriels-cpanel/taches-cron) or from command line. 
```shell
$ EDITOR=nano crontab -e
$ # Add the following line to launch a backup everyday at midnigh:
$ 0 0 * * * $HOME/scripts/backup/backup.sh --backup
$ # Ctrl + o to save your change and Ctrl + x to quit nano
```

### Step 6 - Test our installation / launch our first backup

You are probably impatient at this point to test if your backup is going to work properly.
You can execute that command to launch your first backup: `$HOME/scripts/backup/backup.sh --backup`

What does the script change on my system?<a name="script-change"></a>
---------------------

The script will:
* Create the following directories:
  * $HOME/backup-db
  * $HOME/scripts
  * $HOME/scripts/backup
  * $HOME/scripts/backup/logs
* Create the following files:
  * $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-restic-pwd.txt
  * $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-restic-conf.txt
  * $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-excluded-dirs.txt
  * $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-db-others.txt
  * $HOME/scripts/backup/backup-pgdb-others.txt
* Download needed executables:
  * Download the latest version of restic from github and unzip it within the directory: $HOME/scripts/backup
  * Download the latest version of rclone from github and unzip it within the directory: $HOME/scripts/backup
* Make sure the script file backup.sh is located within the folder $HOME/scripts/backup

Script arguments<a name="script-arguments"></a>
---------------------

The script can be used with two options: `--backup` and `--install`.

The `--backup` option is used to backup the MySQL databases of WordPress installations and other databases not related to WordPress, as well as specified directories. To use this option, run the script with the following command:

The `--install` option is used to install the bacup script, downlaod the latest version of Restic and prepare the environment for running the backup.
If while running "./backup.sh --backup" a file was missing, the --install option can be used to recreate the missing file. 

Script Configuration<a name="script-configuration"></a>
--------------------

Before diving into customizing the script behavior, it's worth noting that if you're only hosting WordPress websites on O2switch, you'll only need to edit `backup-restic-conf.txt` and `backup-restic-pwd.txt`. The default behavior of the script should be sufficient for backing up all of your WordPress installations.

That being said, if you do need to customize the script, you can modify the following files:

* `backup-restic-conf.txt`: This file contains multiple variables that can be edited to manage the script behavior.
* `backup-restic-pwd.txt`: Here you have to enter the password for your restic repository.
* `backup-db-others.txt`: In case you need to backup other MySQL databases besides the automatic backup of the WordPress database, you can add them to this file.
* `backup-pgdb-others.txt`: In case you need to backup PosteGreSQL DB
* `backup-excluded-dirs.txt`: If you want to exclude certain folders from the backup, you can add them to this file. 
   Some folders are already excluded by default. You can use at the root of your home directory, the command: `ls -dA .*/ | grep -Ev '^(\./|\.\./)$'` to obtain a list of all hidden folders at the root of your home directory. Most of these directories can be excluded from backup, and I recommend adding them to this file.

The following variables within the script `backup.sh` can be edited to change the script behavior. But I recommend keeping the default value.

*   `DIR_ROOT`: This variable specifies the root directory that the script will scan to find directories that need to be backed up.
*   `DIR_DB_BACKUP`: The directory where the databases dump will be stored can be changed by modifying this variable.
*   `DIR_WP`: Defines the directory that the script scant to find your wordpress installations
*   `LOG_FILE`: The name format of the log files can be customized by editing this variable.
*   `LOG_DAYS_TO_KEEP`: The amount of time that log files will be retained can be specified by changing this variable.
*   `DUMP_DAYS`: The length of time that a dump file will be retained in the `DIR_DB_BACKUP` folder can be set by modifying this variable.

# Next steps<a name="next-steps"></a>

Looking ahead, I have a few features I'd like to add to the script to make it even more useful. Here are some things I'm planning to work on:

* Updating the script and its components: I'll add an option to update the script and any dependencies, so you always have the latest features and bug fixes.
* Automatic editing of cron at installation: I'll streamline the installation process by automatically configuring the cron job for you.
* Adding more safety checks: I'll build in additional checks to ensure that the script is running smoothly and safely.
* Adding a script check and repair option: I'll include an option to check the current installation and fix any issues in a cleaner way if needed.
* Providing documentation on how to restore files from the restic backup: I'll create a guide to help you restore your files in case you ever need to recover from a data loss.
* Add the automatic support of restic unlock --cleanup-cache if there is a problem with snapshot locked

I'm excited to work on these features and make the script even better. As always, if you have any feedback or suggestions, I'm happy to hear them!
